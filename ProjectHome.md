Are you a laptop DJ? Do you love the filter on the [Pioneer DJM-800](http://www.pioneer.co.uk/uk/products/44/74/461/DJM-800/index.html) mixer? Then this plugin is for you! SKF, as the name implies, is a low-pass / high-pass filter controlled by a single knob. Besides the obvious economy in knob assignment real-estate (come on, not everyone has a Drehbank!), it's perfect for filtersweeps that make everybody on the floor put their hands in the air... you know, like they just don't care.



## Installation ##

SKF is a standard VST effect that comes in a single DLL, so all you have to do is unzip and copy the DLL to your VST plugins folder (nine times out of ten it's `Program Files\Steinberg\VSTPlugins`).

The other files in the zip are the source code in Syhthedit format (not needed for the plugin's operation).

SKF is currently Windows-only (yeah, bummer).



## Usage ##

Drop the SKF on any channel of your favourite DAW. Turn the filter knob to the left for low-pass filtering and to the right for high-pass. Want to give it more edge? Turn up the resonance knob. Simple as that.



## License ##

SKF is FREE and OPEN-SOURCE, released under the General Public License 2.0. The Synthedit source file is included for you to study it, improve it and share it. If you release a version of your own, you'll also need to include the source file. See the COPYING.TXT file for more information.



## Changelog ##

  * First public release
