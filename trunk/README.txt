SINGLE KNOB FILTER VST 0.9 by Fabio FZero

Are you a DJ? Do you love the filter on the Pioneer DJM-800 mixer? Then this plugin is for you! SKF, as the name implies, is a low-pass / high-pass filter controlled by a single knob. Besides the obvious economy in knob assignment real-estate (come on, not everyone has a Drehbank!), it's perfect for filtersweeps that make everybody on the floor put their hands in the air... you know, like they just don't care.


USAGE

Drop the SKF on any channel of your favourite DAW (we all know it's Ableton Live, but nothing stops you from trying it anywhere else). Turn the filter knob to the left for low-pass filtering and to the right for high-pass. Want to give it more edge? Turn up the resonance knob. Simple as that.
